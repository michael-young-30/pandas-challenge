# Heroes of Pymoli

Thanks for taking a look at my analysis of the fictional game, Heroes of Pymoli. The purpose of this project was to understand the demographic and purchasing data to see if we could find trends in the user data.

This challenge involved using Pandas and Python to find answers to questions like:

Purchasing Analysis (Number of items, Total number of purchases, total revenue)
Demographics (total number of players by gender)
Age demographics (broken by bins)

# Tools used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas

# Results (more covered in the jupyter notebook file)

# Analysis

1.	The target audience for this game are males between the ages of 20-24. Although on average Females and Others spend more per purchase, males are by far the gender that purchase the most at 652 purchases. 
The main age group we should focus on are ages 15-24. If we break it down further, we should focus on the 20-24 age group because they buy the most at the 3rd highest average purchase.

2.	While males are our biggest players, we should not discount the female players. They have 81 players, but each player is buying more than the males ($4.47 compared to $4.07). It could be worth investing more in growing our female user base.

3.	Finally, our most popular and most profitable items are Final Citric and Oathbreaker. The items were purchased 13 and 12 times respectively and produced over $50 in revenue. We should continue to promote these items and start producing similar items.
